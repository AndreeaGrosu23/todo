# todo

Your task will be to rewrite a simple Todo app's backend to Spring (it is currently using a lightweight Java server called Spark). In this assignment you should use everything you learned about Spring Boot until now.

Your tasks:

Remove Spark and other dependencies from the project (remove them from the pom.xml and sync)
Add Spring Boot as a dependency to the pom.xml file or generate a new Spring Boot project with Spring Initializer (IntelliJ)
Rewrite the code to get everything working with Spring
Rewrite the Todo in-memory persistence to JPA (convert the necessary classes to entities, write repositories, etc). We recommend to use H2 or PostgreSQL
Notes:

You do not need to rewrite any of the HTML/CSS/JS files
First try out every feature in a browser
press F12, open the Network tab, and watch what's happening! It helps a ton with rewriting.
